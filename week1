for week 1 me and my teammates took time to introduce ourselves to each othere, set up github collabrative repo and were working on the project introduction, scope, NFRS.
i persoanally worked on breaking down the clients initial specification to outline a project scope and the main functional requirements.
i also worked on preparing questions to ask the client to clarify any misunderstandings and to generally understand the specifications better.
