in week 5 which is the sprint week, i and the team agreed to pick up tasks individually using trello to keep track of whos doing what.
i started with front end development of the log in page, then later assisted in adding back end functionality to it. 
i then moved on to developing the nav bar and side bar which were later on improved by dante. 
i ended up working on the all cases page, providing the feature to view only, view all the cases and an update button which allows you to make changes to cases for example closing cases.
in the meeting with the client i got the chance to showcase my work and receive feedback regarding the all cases page, where the client expressed hed like a search and filter feature and paging to be worked, which will be where i improve.
