on week 8 i worked on-
- going through the tasks i completed in sprint week 1 and making sure all functionality is working after merging everyones work. 
- deleted the update case status button as it didnt make sense to have and raised bugs and issues 
- sorted out the all cases table to only show the stsatus but not as a button.
